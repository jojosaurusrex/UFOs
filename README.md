# UFOs

## Overview
During Week 11, this challenge was given to the students of UCSD-VIRT-DATA-PT-02-2022-U-B-TTH in order to gauge their capabilities and understanding of JavaScript and HTML code with supplied data. The specifics of this challenge are as followed:
- Create five list elements for filtering in index.html
- Event listener from the practice is modified to detect changes to each filter
- The function filterTable() loops through every filter and keeps any data that matches

In more general terms, this week I learned:
- JavaScript basics
- Building webpages with JavaScript: Storyboarding
- How to write and use JavaScript functions and loops
- How to build a table using the combination of JavaScript and HTML


## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: JavaScript and HTML via Google Chrome


## Challenge Results
The results of the challenge can be seen in Figure 1. This is what will be seen when we open this index.html within your browser. You can use each and every filter to specify the search of UFO data.

In Figure 2, we can see how two of the filters can narrow down our results quite a bit.

## Challenge Summary
The challenge has to be one of the most frustuating modules I have dealt with, but I am learning quite alot. I had quite a bit of trouble with getting any of my data to load when I used "const tableData = data;" in my app.js for both the module and the challenge. I am still unclear why that caused me any issues, but once I changed it to "var tableData = data;" it worked perfectly fine. For further development in this challenge, I would challenge future students to incorporate the button even after all five filters have been added. As for a recommendation for those writing the module and the challenge, I think it would be beneficial to have the one of the TAs or professor go through the module and challenge a week or two in advance, so they can confirm everything is running smoothly.
